# How does it work?

ABCpdf .NET goes Direct to PDF™ without print drivers, so it’s fast.

It’s fully multithreaded and can be used flexibly in ASP.NET, COM+, or Windows applications.

Avoid external libraries that pipeline requests; ABCpdf .NET doesn’t rely on other software, so it can be completely multithreaded without bottlenecks.
