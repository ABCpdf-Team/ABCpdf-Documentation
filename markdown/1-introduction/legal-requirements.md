# Legal Requirements

Adobe claims IP rights over the Adobe PDF specification, and ABCpdf aims to ensure those rights are upheld.

By installing ABCpdf you accept the license agreement, including abiding by the Adobe PDF Specification conditions of use.

Adobe permits software to create, display, and manipulate PDFs, conditional on respecting permissions embedded within existing PDF documents.

ABCpdf is a component (not an end-user application), but when you create software for end users, your software must respect these permissions. You are legally bound to do so by the ABCpdf license and Adobe’s conditions of use.
