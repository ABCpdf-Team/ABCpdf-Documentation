# What’s Cool?

ABCpdf goes Direct to PDF™ and is fast. It doesn’t rely on other software so it can be fully multithreaded without bottlenecks.

It’s simple yet powerful: get productive quickly, or use fine low-level control when needed.

Create PDFs from scratch or read and modify existing ones. Add pages from other documents for joining and stitching. Stream documents directly to browsers. Support up to PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2:2017).

Import HTML/CSS from local or remote sites. Treat HTML as placed media or flow across areas/pages/columns. Choose Chrome-, Firefox-, or IE-style engines with FireShield sandboxing. Options provide control over rendering and DOM; engines support HTML5, CSS3, SVG, web fonts, AJAX, WebGL, and more.

Render PDFs to raster formats (JPEG, GIF, TIFF, PSD, JPEG 2000, HEIF, WebP, DDS, JPEG XR) and vector formats (EMF, EPS, XPS, SVG, HTML, DOCX, WebGL, SWF). Control alpha, compression, resolutions, selective rendering via layers and operator filters; validated against Ghent PDF Output Suite 5.0.

Support for a wide range of graphics: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, PSD/PSB, EXIF, WMF/EMF, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, HEIF, WebP, RAW, DDS, PS/EPS, XPS, WPF, SVG, SWF. Reference image data from multiple locations for watermarks. Full PostScript compatibility.

Full support for XPS/OXPS and EPS: convert PDF↔XPS/EPS with preservation of color spaces and embedded fonts where possible; render directly to Grayscale/RGB/CMYK EPS when desired.

PDF/A output, validation, and conversion that works on most documents, including third-party PDFs. Transparency flattening preserves vector format while removing transparency.

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) import for PDF output; see WPFTable example.

Supports many document formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, WordPerfect, Lotus, AutoCAD). Read them in; details may require helper apps like WordGlue .NET, Microsoft Office, or OpenOffice.org.

Text layout control: paragraph indent, kerning, tracking, word/line/paragraph spacing, justification. Synthesized bold/italic where multiple typefaces aren’t referenced.

Unicode and foreign language support: embed Unicode fonts, draw horizontally or vertically, subset large CJK fonts, bidirectional script support, contextual ligatures.

Styled text with box chaining for flowing text around images/objects; advanced effects like text on a curve or drop shadows via examples.

Advanced transformations: rotation, magnification, skew, translation.

Multiple layout approaches: programmatic tables, WPF content to PDF, ABCpdf13.Drawing wrapper for System.Drawing, XML to PDF/tagged PDF examples.

Sophisticated color spaces: RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, calibrated, spot colors; colorizing grayscale with spot, converting between spaces.

Direct ICC-based RGB/CMYK/Lab import from TIFF/PSD/PSB; full TIFF/PSD support for all color spaces, compression, bit depths up to HDR.

Transparency everywhere: alpha, soft masks, chromakey masks, transparent images.

Encryption and signatures: user permissions, 40–128 bit keys, signature validity checks, revision comparison, revert to prior revisions.

Cloud API integrations: OCR and image analysis via Google APIs for accessibility; OCR for raster and vector text.

Fields and Forms: placeholders, assigning values, stamping fields, creating annotations, comb fields, Acrobat JavaScript for calculations/triggers/callbacks.

Digital signatures: software/hardware/cloud certificates, PAdES B/T/LT/LTA.

PDF→annotated SVG for element identification and mapping to operators for search/replace and image identification.

PDF optimization and size reduction: remove unused images/fonts, resample/recompress, flatten, minimize output size.

Text and image analysis operations: extract de-hyphenated/de-ligatured text; select items and operate on selections.

Custom analysis via content stream deconstruction APIs: separate spot color graphics, change line widths, more.

PDF accessibility: add semantic tagging for PDF/UA and Section 508 compliance, including headers, footers, tables, lists, sections.

ABCpdfView sample app: open, view, print PDFs; edit text/styles; insert/delete/reorder pages; watermark documents. Full source included.

Image control: resize via high-quality resampling; assign/convert color spaces; compress (CCITT, JPEG, Flate, JPEG 2000); resample bit depths; analyze size/resolution/placement.

Floating point precision for precise positioning; variable precision to balance precision and legacy compatibility.

Low-level PDF access: Atom and Element classes for direct structure/content stream work across the PDF 2.0 spec.
