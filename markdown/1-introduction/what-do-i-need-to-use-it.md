# What do I need to use it?

You can run ABCpdf .NET on all Windows versions since Windows Vista.

You need .NET 4.0 or later.

If you’re rendering 3D PDFs, you will need OpenGL 3.1 compliant graphics drivers.

Finally, you’ll need ABCpdf .NET itself.

ABCpdf .NET includes a COM layer that mimics the interface of ABCpdf ASP, allowing one product for both .NET and legacy COM deployment. This brings advantages like native x64 support and features like SVG import.
