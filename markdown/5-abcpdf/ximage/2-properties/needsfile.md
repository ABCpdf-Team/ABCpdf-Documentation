# NeedsFile Property

&nbsp;

## Notes

This property is true if the object has been created with an XReadOptions with ReadModule that uses an Operation (whether Operation is actually null or not) and the file specified is required to exist as long as the object is not cleared, disposed of, or garbage-collected. The object does not delete the file when it is disposed of.
