# Ascender Property

&nbsp;

## Notes

The distance between the line spacing below the top of the text frame and the first baseline.

Because LineSpacing is always applied at the top, the top of the text rectangle needs to be shifted up by LineSpacing for better control of the position of the first line.

This property is measured in 1000ths of the font size. When it is -1, default spacing will be applied.
