<p>Under most circumstances, you will want to install
ABCpdf .NET using the standard installer and register it using the
PDFSettings control panel.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may wish to install ABCpdf
manually. To do this, you will need the files listed below as obtained from the ABCpdf programs folder (look in %PROGRAMFILES%). There are different files for Linux deployment which you will find in the Linux subdirectory.</p>

<p>You should generally put these items in the bin directory (next to ABCpdf.dll). ABCpdf uses a LoadLibrary type search to find the EXE, so it can be put in other places, but taking advantage of this may result in an installation which is confusing to other people.</p>
<p>Be aware that on x64 Windows,  if you put ABCGeckoWP.exe  in %SystemRoot%\System32,
File System Redirection will prevent it from finding the XULRunner38_0 folder. For this type of deployment you would need to use  %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64 instead.</p></td>

<p>If you are deploying manually to a restricted permission environment
such as IIS and also you are using the MSHtml engine for converting HTML
content, then you may need to check the registry for certain structures.
The registry key HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Devices
should contain printer entries. The Microsoft XPS Document Writer that
comes with Windows suffices to satisfy this requirement. If there are no
entries in this key, you can copy them from HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Devices.
Absence of entries in this registry key may result in errors from the
MSHtml engine when using ABCpdf in IIS.</p>

      <td><p><b>Background. </b>Why XULRunner?</p>
          <p>Well,
XUL (pronounced zool) is a kind of enhanced XHTML designed for cross
platform user interface development. The name XUL is both an acronym
and also a reference to the scene in Ghostbusters in which an ancient
god called Zuul possesses Dana and tells Dr Venkman,</p>
        <blockquote>"There is no Dana, only Zuul!"</blockquote>
        <p>Since
XUL incorporates everything needed for an application in a completely
self-contained manner, the developers adopted the catchphrase,</p>
        <blockquote>"There is no data, only XUL."</blockquote>
        <p>Other references to the Ghostbusters movie are scattered throughout the development of Mozilla, Gecko and Firefox.</p>

<p>Most calls to ABCpdf will result in a trial
license being installed if it is found that no license has yet been
installed. At minimum, all that is required is to query the value of
the <a href="../5-abcpdf/xsettings/2-properties/licensedescription.htm">XSettings.LicenseDescription</a>
property. Write access to the registry is required for a trial to be inserted.</p>
<p><span class="language">[C#]</span><br>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13;
MessageBox.Show("New License: " + XSettings.LicenseDescription);
</code></pre></p>
<p>You can use a full license key as provided to you
when you purchase, or you can use a trial license key copied from the
PDFSettings application. To enter a license key, call <a href="../5-abcpdf/xsettings/1-methods/installsystemlicense.htm">XSettings.InstallLicense</a>
or at application startup before any ABCpdf objects have been created. If you have purchased a
Redistribution license, you may prefer to call <a href="../5-abcpdf/xsettings/1-methods/installredistributionlicense.htm">XSettings.InstallRedistributionLicense</a>.
In both cases the license will remain available to the
process until it unloads.</p>
<p>Make sure you check the return value to ensure that the license has taken. If it has not, then report back the XSettings.LicenseDescription and the XSettings.Version. Something like this.</p>
<p><span class="language">[C#]</span><br>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using WebSupergoo.ABCpdf13;

<p><b>Shared Hosts.</b> Most
installations of ABCpdf .NET on shared servers are seamless. However,
you need to be aware that you are a guest on the server and your host
may have locked down permissions in ways which will make your life
difficult. If this occurs, there is typically little that either you or
we can do about it.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend deployment on a
dedicated server. Dedicated servers are cheaper than you might think,
and the level of control they allow is only one of the very significant
advantages they afford. It is one of the best decisions you can make.</p>
<p>If you are intending to install on a shared
server, the essential thing to do is to deploy early and discover any
issues before they become major problems.</p>
