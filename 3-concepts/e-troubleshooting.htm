            <p>We do not expect you to have any problems with our software but 
              if you do we offer a full level of support as standard. If you need 
              an extra level of security we offer a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.websupergoo.com/purchase.htm">Platinum 
              Level Support</a> program offering a priority channel through to 
              our engineers.</p>
            <p>Your first port of call should be to check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.websupergoo.com/support.htm">FAQ 
              on our website</a>. If it doesn't cover your particular query you 
              can mail us via the email addresses listed there. We prefer queries 
              via email as technical issues are often complicated and require 
              some thought on our side as well as yours. However if you need to 
              telephone then numbers are listed on our web site.</p>

            <p>Most bug reports relate to misunderstandings so if you're reporting 
              a bug please do first check the documentation carefully. If you 
              feel that an issue hasn't been explained well please do tell us 
              so we can correct it.</p>
            <p>Most configuration problems relate to security settings. If you 
              are operating under a restricted security account please try running 
              your code in a standard application while logged on as Administrator. 
              It will only take you a few minutes to do this and it will instantly 
              tell you if you have a security problem or not.</p>
            <p>Because ABCpdf typically renders URLs from the server-side the 
              server itself may impose limits. For example if your server has 
              a video card with a limited range of colors then certain graphics 
              operations may be limited to that number of colors.</p>
            <p>If you find anything that doesn't seem right please say. We do not 
              know unless you tell us.</p>

            <p>Remember to tell us what Operating System you're on and what version 
              of ABCpdf you're using. You can get the exact version of ABCpdf 
              from the PDFSettings control panel. If you're using an older version 
              of ABCpdf we will be asking you if the problem occurs using the 
              current download so you may wish to check our downloads page.</p>
            <p>If the problem involves URL rendering please tell us exactly what 
              version of Internet Explorer you have installed on your server. 
              You can get the exact version of Internet Explorer from the About 
              Internet Explorer menu item. If you're using an older version of 
              Internet Explorer we will be asking you if the problem occurs using 
              the current version.</p>
            <p> Please give us a precise description of what's gone wrong. We 
              like to see examples so if you have reasonably sized input or output 
              documents which illustrate your point please do feel welcome to 
              mail them to us. </p>
            <p>If the problem relates to a particular resource which we may not 
              have access to - maybe a font or an image - please do send these 
              to us so we can find out what may be unusual about them. If you 
              think we might like to see your code please show it to us (but please 
              do not send your entire project).</p>
            <p>If something's working partially please tell us what parts are 
              working and what parts are not. If you have any theories or suspicions

              unusual software or configuration that might be relevant.</p>

            <p>The fastest and most reliable way to resolve an issue is to provide 
              a standalone code sample which demonstrates a problem. Please provide 
              input and output resources and tell us what you think is wrong with 
              your output.</p>
            <p>A code sample should be small and should illustrate one particular 
              problem. Please do not send us your entire project and please do 
              not send us code we can't run because it's tied to your particular 
              setup.</p>
            <p>Please put a little bit of effort into defining exactly what the 
              problem is. In the long run this will save you time.</p>
            <p>Once we have a standalone code example we can tell you exactly 
              why your code isn't doing what you think it should. If it's a problem 
              with our software we'll fix it or suggest a workaround. Even if 
              the problem is outside our software we are often able to suggest 
              workarounds. </p>
