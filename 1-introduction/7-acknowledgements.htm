are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the

</ol>
<p><font size="-3">You may add Your own
copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as

<p><font size="-3">5. Submission of

Contributions. </font></p>
<p><font size="-3">6. Trademarks. This
License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,

<p><font size="-3">7. Disclaimer of
Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF

Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
of such damages. </font></p>
<p><font size="-3">9. Accepting Warranty
or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability. </font></p>

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
  Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
  Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>
  document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General<br>
  Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU<br>
  General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
  0. Additional Definitions.<br>
  As used herein, 'this License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General<br>
  Public License, and the 'GNU GPL' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
  'The Library' refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an<br>
  Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
  An 'Application' is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,<br>
  but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class<br>
  defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
  A 'Combined Work' is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with<br>
  the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work<br>
  was made is also called the 'Linked Version'.<br>
  The 'Minimal Corresponding Source' for a Combined Work means the Corresponding<br>
  Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the<br>
  Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application,<br>
  and not on the Linked Version.<br>
  The 'Corresponding Application Code' for a Combined Work means the object code<br>
  and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs<br>
  needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the<br>
  System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being<br>
  bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers<br>
  to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility<br>
  (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may<br>
  convey a copy of the modified version:<br>
  a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
  in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility<br>
  still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
  b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License<br>
  applicable to that copy.<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your<br>
  choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical<br>
  parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions<br>
  and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used<br>
  in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br>
  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,<br>
  effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained<br>
  in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if<br>
  you also do each of the following:<br>
  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is<br>
  used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<br>
  b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
  c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include<br>
  the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
  d) Do one of the following:<br>
  0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and<br>
  the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that<br>
  permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version<br>
  of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified<br>
  by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.<br>
  1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable<br>
  mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present<br>
  on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified<br>
  version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.<br>
  e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required<br>
  to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent<br>
  that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of<br>
  the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a<br>
  modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation<br>
  Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding<br>
  Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
  Corresponding Source.)<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by<br>
  side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not<br>
  Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined<br>
  library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the<br>
  Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms<br>
  of this License.<br>
  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work<br>
  based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined<br>
  form of the same work.<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar<br>
  in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems<br>
  or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
  as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option<br>
  of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any<br>
  later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
  License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
  ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether<br>
  future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that<br>
  proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization<br>
  for you to choose that version for the Library.<br>

  provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and<br>
  federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such<br>
  jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if<br>
  you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in<br>
  the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you<br>
  reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year<br>
  after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.<br>
  Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and<br>
  services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or<br>
  received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the<br>
  prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys&iacute; fees. In the event of<br>
  any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection<br>
  with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith,<br>
  to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within<br>
  a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit<br>
  such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved<br>
  through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy<br>
  available to them under applicable law.</p>
<p class="smallprint">Void Where Prohibited<br>
  Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino,<br>
  California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various<br>
  locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide,<br>
  not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered<br>
  through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations,<br>
  or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Apple reserves the<br>
  right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature,<br>
  product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature,<br>
  product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to<br>
  access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative<br>
  and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.</p>
<p class="smallprint">Miscellaneous<br>
  You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of<br>
  such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any<br>
  applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export<br>
  laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="smallprint">If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other<br>
  tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions<br>
  shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with<br>
  a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that<br>
  these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use<br>
  constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of<br>
  the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings<br>
  previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby<br>
  superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you<br>
  enter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms<br>
  of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Apple&iacute;s failure<br>
  to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be<br>
  construed as a waiver by Apple of any provision or any right it has to enforce<br>
  these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or<br>
  any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These<br>
  Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or<br>
  remedies on any third parties.</p>

  Version 2, June 1991<br>
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</p>
<p class="smallprint">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
  Preamble<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share<br>
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee<br>
  your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free<br>
  for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free<br>
  Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit<br>
  to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU<br>
  Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General<br>
  Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute<br>
  copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive<br>
  source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or<br>
  use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny<br>
  you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions<br>
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the<br>
  software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a<br>
  program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights<br>
  that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer<br>
  you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or<br>
  modify the software.<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that<br>
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the<br>
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to<br>
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced<br>
  by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish<br>
  to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually<br>
  obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent<br>
  this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br>
  free use or not licensed at all.<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice<br>
  placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms<br>
  of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program<br>
  or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any<br>
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the<br>
  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
  the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by<br>
  this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not<br>
  restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents<br>
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running<br>
  the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as<br>
  you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately<br>
  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;<br>
  keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
  along with the Program.<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at<br>
  your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus<br>
  forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications<br>
  or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of<br>
  these conditions:</p>
<p class="smallprint">a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that<br>
  you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p class="smallprint">b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in<br>
  part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed<br>
  as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p class="smallprint">c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you<br>
  must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary<br>
  way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice<br>
  and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a<br>
  warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,<br>
  and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the<br>
  Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,<br>
  your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections<br>
  of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered<br>
  independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,<br>
  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But<br>
  when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this<br>
  License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and<br>
  thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights<br>
  to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to<br>
  control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br>
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the<br>
  Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or<br>
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under<br>
  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2<br>
  above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<p class="smallprint">a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,<br>
  which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
  customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p class="smallprint">b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give<br>
  any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing<br>
  source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding<br>
  source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p class="smallprint">c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute<br>
  corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial<br>
  distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable<br>
  form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making<br>
  modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all<br>
  the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface<br>
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation<br>
  of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed<br>
  need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating<br>
  system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the<br>
  executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access<br>
  to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source<br>
  code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though<br>
  third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as<br>
  expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,<br>
  sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate<br>
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or<br>
  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so<br>
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.<br>
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program<br>
  or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not<br>
  accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any<br>
  work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,<br>
  and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program<br>
  or works based on it.<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the<br>
  recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,<br>
  distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may<br>
  not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights<br>
  granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties<br>
  to this License.<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement<br>
  or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed<br>
  on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the<br>
  conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this<br>
  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations<br>
  under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not<br>
  permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies<br>
  directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it<br>
  and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular<br>
  circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as<br>
  a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or<br>
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this<br>
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software<br>
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many<br>
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is<br>
  up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software<br>
  through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a<br>
  consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries<br>
  either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who<br>
  places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution<br>
  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or<br>
  among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the<br>
  limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br>
  General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in<br>
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems<br>
  or concerns.<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies<br>
  a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;,<br>
  you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version<br>
  or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program<br>
  does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever<br>
  published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose<br>
  distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.<br>
  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the<br>
  Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision<br>
  will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives<br>
  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
  NO WARRANTY<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE<br>
  PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED<br>
  IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot;<br>
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT<br>
  LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH<br>
  YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY<br>
  SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL<br>
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE<br>
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,<br>
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY<br>
  TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE<br>
  OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR<br>
  OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>

  modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications<br>
  made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor<br>
  Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code<br>
  in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.<br>
  3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
  3.1. Application of License.<br>
  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by<br>
  the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source<br>
  Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this<br>
  License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and<br>
  You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>
  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that<br>
  alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'<br>
  rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the<br>
  additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br>
  3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available<br>
  in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an<br>
  Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone<br>
  to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via<br>
  Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>
  months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months<br>
  after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available<br>
  to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version<br>
  remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by<br>
  a third party.<br>
  3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
  You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting<br>
  the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must<br>
  include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,<br>
  from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>
  Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version<br>
  or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br>
  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
  (a) Third Party Claims<br>
  If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual<br>
  property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor<br>
  under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source<br>
  Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the<br>
  claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor<br>
  obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in<br>
  Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor<br>
  makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate<br>
  mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the<br>
  Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
  (b) Contributor APIs<br>
  If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and<br>
  Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to<br>
  implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the legal<br>
  file.<br>
  (c) Representations.<br>
  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above,<br>
  Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original<br>
  creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed<br>
  by this License.<br>
  3.5. Required Notices.<br>
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it<br>
  is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its<br>
  structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant<br>
  directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created<br>
  one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice<br>
  described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>
  for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights<br>
  relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,<br>
  support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.<br>
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,<br>
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby<br>
  agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability<br>
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>
  support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of<br>
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if<br>
  You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is<br>
  available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where<br>
  You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously<br>
  included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral<br>
  in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may<br>
  distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a<br>
  license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided<br>
  that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for<br>
  the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights<br>
  in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You<br>
  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it<br>
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by<br>
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to<br>
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br>
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br>
  3.7. Larger Works.<br>
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed<br>
  by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.<br>
  In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled<br>
  for the Covered Code.<br>
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with<br>
  respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or<br>
  regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum<br>
  extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such<br>
  description must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>
  be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent<br>
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed<br>
  for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
  5. Application of this License.<br>
  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice<br>
  in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br>
  6. Versions of the License.<br>
  6.1. New Versions<br>
  Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br>
  distinguishing version number.<br>
  6.2. Effect of New Versions<br>
  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,<br>
  You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also<br>
  choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the<br>
  License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify<br>
  the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br>
  6.3. Derivative Works<br>
  If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in<br>
  order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this<br>
  License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;,<br>
&quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in<br>
  your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)<br>
  otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ<br>
  from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name<br>
  of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br>
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br>
  7. Disclaimer of warranty<br>
  Covered code is provided under this license on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranty<br>
  of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties<br>
  that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose<br>
  or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered<br>
  code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not<br>
  the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary<br>
  servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an<br>
  essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder<br>
  except under this disclaimer.<br>
  8. Termination<br>
  8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if<br>
  You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of<br>
  becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly<br>
  granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
  8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding<br>
  declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial<br>
  Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as<br>
&quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:<br>
  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,<br>
  then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or<br>
  2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate<br>
  prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:<br>
  (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty<br>
  for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or<br>
  (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against<br>
  such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment<br>
  arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation<br>
  claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1<br>
  and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period<br>
  specified above. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>
  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights<br>
  granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked<br>
  effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,<br>
  Modifications made by that Participant.<br>
  8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that<br>
  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent<br>
  where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the<br>
  initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the<br>
  licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>
  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<br>
  8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user<br>
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly<br>
  granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive<br>
  termination.<br>
  9. Limitation of liability<br>
  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including<br>
  negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any<br>
  other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any<br>
  of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental,<br>
  or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages<br>
  for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and<br>
  all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been<br>
  informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall<br>
  not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's<br>
  negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions<br>
  do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,<br>
  so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.<br>
  10. U.S. government end users<br>
  The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.<br>
  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial<br>
  computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212<br>
  (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through<br>
  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with<br>
  only those rights set forth herein.<br>
  11. Miscellaneous<br>
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.<br>
  If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision<br>
  shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This<br>
  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent<br>
  applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law<br>
  provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen<br>
  of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of<br>
  America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the<br>
  jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with<br>
  venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible<br>
  for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'<br>
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts<br>
  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation<br>
  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the<br>
  drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>
  12. Responsibility for claims<br>
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for<br>
  claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of<br>
  rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and<br>
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing<br>
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>
  13. Multiple-licensed code<br>
  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;.<br>
&quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions<br>
  of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if<br>
  any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br>

<p class="smallprint"> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
</p>
<p class="smallprint"> This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
  the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
  License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 0. Additional Definitions.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
  General Public License.</p>
<p> <span class="smallprint">&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
  other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</span></p>
<p class="smallprint"> An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
  by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
  of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
  Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
  with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked<br>
  Version&quot;.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br>
  Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
  for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
  based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br>
  object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
  and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
  Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
  version:</p>
<p class="smallprint"> a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p>
<p class="smallprint"> b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
  this License applicable to that copy.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
<p class="smallprint"> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
  covered by this License.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
  document.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 4. Combined Works.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
  the following:</p>
<p class="smallprint"> a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
  covered by this License.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
  document.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
  these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
  copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> d) Do one of the following:</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
  License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
  suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
  recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
  the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
  manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
  Corresponding Source.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
  Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
  a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
  system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
  of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
  Version.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
  be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
  GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
  necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
  Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
  Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
  you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
  Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
  Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
  for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 5. Combined Libraries.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
  choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
<p class="smallprint"> a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
  conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
  is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
  accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;<br>
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p class="smallprint"> If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
  Library.</p>

#  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.<br>
#<br>
#  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
#  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
#  that the provisions of Section 3 (&quot;NO WARRANTY&quot;) will ALWAYS appear<br>

#  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having<br>
#  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.<br>
#<br>
#  NO WARRANTY<br>
#<br>
#  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the<br>
#  research and development conducted during the project and is provided<br>
#  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the<br>
#  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,<br>
#  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term &quot;warranty&quot; used herein<br>
#  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,<br>
#  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of<br>
#  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of<br>
#  any right of any third party.<br>
#<br>
#  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
#  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
#  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
#  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
#<br>
#  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
#  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
#  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,<br>
#  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all<br>
#  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental<br>
#  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection<br>
#  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material<br>
#  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,<br>
#  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had<br>
#  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the<br>
#  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the<br>
#  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term<br>
#  &quot;use&quot; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,<br>
#  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the<br>
#  production of secondary products from the program.<br>
#<br>
#  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
#  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
#  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or<br>
#  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>
#  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted<br>
#  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted<br>
#  above as far as the program is concerned.<br>

Time Zone Database<br>
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br>
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br>
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br>
Database section 7.<br>
# 7.  Database Ownership<br>
#<br>
#    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br>
#    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br>
#    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br>
#    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br>
#    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br>
#    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br>
#    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br>
#    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br>
#    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br>
#    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made<br>
#    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person<br>
#    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br>
#    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

  SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="smallprint">PREAMBLE<br>
  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
<p class="smallprint">The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p class="smallprint">DEFINITIONS<br>

<p class="smallprint">2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
<p class="smallprint">3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.</p>
<p class="smallprint">4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.</p>
