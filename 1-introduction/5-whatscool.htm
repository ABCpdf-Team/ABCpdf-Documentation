<tr> <td> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABCpdf gets up close and personal! Because it goes Direct
to PDF&#153; it's incredibly fast. Because ABCpdf doesn't rely on any other software
it can be completely multithreaded without any unpleasant bottlenecks.</p><p>ABCpdf
is simple yet powerful. It's designed so you can get up to speed and productive
within ten minutes. Yet if you want fine low-level control you can have that too
with ABCpdf.</p>
<p>Create PDF documents from scratch or read and modify existing
PDF documents. Add pages from other documents for seamless joining, insertion
and stitching of multiple documents. Stream your documents direct to your client
web browser without going via the disk. All up into the GB range and beyond. All with support up to and including PDF 2.0 - ISO 32000-2:2017.</p>
<p>Import HTML
/ CSS pages from local or remote web sites. Placed HTML support means your HTML
can be treated just like any other media - placed wherever you like on the page.
Paged HTML support allows you to flow your HTML from one area to another - across
pages or columns or both. Select between google Chrome style, Firefox style and Internet Explorer style HTML rendering engines. Run in a our FireShield sandbox for extras security. A vast range of options gives you full control over
the HTML rendering process and DOM. Different engines give you amazing levels of compatibilities with associated technologies like HTML5, CSS3, SVG, web fonts and Font Awesome, AJAX, WebGL and many more.</p>
<p>Render your PDF documents in a variety
of formats. Output your pages in raster formats like JPEG, GIF, TIFF, PSD, JPEG 2000, High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF), WebP, DDS or JPEG XR 
in any of a variety of color spaces and bit depths. Alternatively choose vector
formats like EMF, EPS, XPS, SVG, HTML, DOCX, WebGL and SWF (Flash) for specialist areas such as high
resolution print work. Control advanced rendering settings such as alpha, compression
type, multiple pages and different horizontal and vertical resolutions. Selective rendering using Optional Content Groups (layers) and operator types. All validated against the Ghent PDF Output Suite 5.0.</p>
<p>Add
virtually any graphic into your PDFs. ABCpdf supports JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG, PSD, PSB,
EXIF, WMF, EMF, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF), WebP, RAW, DDS, PS, EPS, XPS, WPF, SVG and SWF (Flash) amongst others.
Additionally you can reference image data from multiple locations in your document
- great for inserting watermarks and other frequently used graphics. ABCpdf is
fully PostScript compatible.</p>
<p>Full support for the XML Paper Specification (XPS), Open XML Paper Specification (OXPS) and for Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). Microsoft XPS
            provides an alternative for page description and document storage
            but it is not compatible with the de-facto PDF standard. EPS is widely used in printing but often provides compatibility headaches when it comes to interoperability with PDF. ABCpdf
            supports full interoperability between Adobe PDF and Microsoft XPS and EPS.
            Convert your PDF documents to XPS or EPS. Convert your XPS or EPS documents to
            PDF. And our conversion routines are carefully written to preserve
            the natural structure of your source documents wherever possible. So
            this means the preservation of color spaces and the preservation or
            conversion of embedded fonts. Unless of course you want to change the format in which case you can render directly to Grayscale, RGB or CMYK EPS.</p>
<p>Output, validation and conversion to PDF/A standards. Conversion is made to work the way it should - it operates on practically all documents - even documents provided by third parties. A partner in this is  transparency flattening which is a technology which allows you to remove transparency from your documents while leaving the vector nature of the format intact.</p>
<p>Full support for the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
            Microsoft WPF was the  graphics sub-system originally developed for .NET 3.0. Of
            course with a  graphics API drawing to screen a  PDF export
            facility is needed too. As such ABCpdf  comes with full WPF
            import capability. See our WPFTable example project for details and
            examples.</p>
<p>Not only does ABCpdf support PDF, HTML and Rich Text Format (RTF) natively
but  it also supports a wide range of other document formats. Formats like
Microsoft Word (.doc), Microsoft Excel (.xls), PowerPoint (.ppt),  WordPerfect (.wpd), Lotus 1-2-3 (.wk1) and AutoCAD (.dxf). All you need
to do is <A
            HREF="../5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/read.htm">read</A> them in! <A
            HREF="#note">*</A></p>
<p>ABCpdf allows you precise control over the
way that your text is laid out. Paragraph indent, kerning and tracking, word spacing,
line spacing, paragraph spacing and horizontal justification are just some of
the settings available. ABCpdf supports synthesized bold and italic typeface styles
for situations in which you do not want to reference multiple typefaces. </p>
<p>ABCpdf
supports Unicode and foreign languages. Reference fonts from the relevant foreign
language pack or embed Unicode fonts for guaranteed fidelity of reproduction on
any platform. Draw text horizontally or vertically and quickly subset large CJK
fonts with minimal use of memory and impact on server load. Work with bidirectional script such as Hebrew and contextual ligatures in languages such as Arabic</p>
<p>Styled text allows easy creation
and layout of multi-styled text; supporting text box chaining to allow you to
easily and automatically flow text through from one area to another, around images and other irregular objects. More complex options like text on a curve or drop shadows are simple to implement using our example code.</p>
<p>Apply
advanced transformations like rotation, magnification, skew and translation. This
means you can draw rotated text, images and graphics all with only a few simple
commands.</p>
<p>ABCpdf allows multiple different approaches to layout and document
structure. The Table project shows how to use programmatic table based layout.
The WPF Table project shows how to take WPF based content and convert it to PDF.
The ABCpdf13.Drawing wrapper namespace exists for easy porting of System.Drawing
code for PDF output. Or if you're more interested in XML to PDF or tagged PDF
output there are the Tagged PDF Example projects.</p>
<p>ABCpdf supports sophisticated
color spaces. Mix and match RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, calibrated color spaces and
spot colors. Any kind of graphic from text to lines to blocks of color can be
drawn in any of these color spaces. You can even perform complex operations
like colorizing grayscale images using spot colors or converting from one color
space to another.</p>
<p>ABCpdf supports direct import of ICC based RGB,
CMYK and Lab images from TIFF, PSD and PSB. Full TIFF and PSD support for all color spaces, compression models and bit depths up to HDR (High-dynamic-range). This means you can produce high-quality, print-ready PDFs
directly from your applications.</p>
<p>ABCpdf supports transparency everywhere.
Any kind of graphic from text to lines to blocks of color can be drawn transparently
using a simple alpha value to control levels of opacity. You can apply soft masks
or chromakey style masks to images for selective transparency. Or you can draw
transparent images such as GIF using simple calls.</p>
<p>Create encrypted or signed
PDFs for secure storage of PDF documents. Apply user permissions and secure these
permissions with encryption keys from 40 to 128 bits in size. Check signed documents
for validity. Examine different revisions of documents to find changes between them. Revert back to any previously saved revision for comparison.</p>
<p>Simple integration with Google cloud APIs for optical character recognition (OCR) and image analysis for accessibility. OCR integration for efficient analysis of both raster and vector text types.</p>
<p>ABCpdf supports Fields and Forms. Use placeholder fields in
your template documents to position and lay out dynamically created elements or
assign field values directly. Stamp fields directly into the PDF to prevent them
being modified. Create new annotations, anything from simple text fields through
to multiple incrementally updated signatures. With advanced support for exotic types of field structure such as combs and for Acrobat JavaScript for field calculations, triggers and callbacks.</p>
<p>Digital signature signing and verification using software, hardware or cloud based certificates. Support for standards like PAdES for standards compliant signatures - B for the base level, T to add a timestamp, LT for long term archival and PAdES LTA for extended long term archival.</p>
<p>ABCpdf now supports conversion
of PDF content into annotated SVG. This allows you to identify individual elements
on a page and map them back to the operators in the original PDF file. So it lets
you perform operations like search and replace on PDF text or identify individual
images on a page. </p>
<p>PDF optimization and size reduction provides whole document optimization using a variety of options to reduce font sizes, remove embedded fonts, to resample and recompress images, to flatten wherever possible for the smallest possible output.</p>
<p>PDF analysis has been extended into easy-to-use operations for text and images. Simple on the surface but sophisticated underneath, they allow you to extract common-sense, de-hyphenated and de-ligatured text from PDFs. Then  select items of that text within the PDF and perform operations on those selections.</p>
<p>If you have your own custom PDF analysis needs these can be easily implemented using the content stream deconstruction APIs. So if you want to separate out spot color graphics or change the width of lines or indeed pretty much anything, there are simple classes to allow you to achieve this.</p>
<p>PDF accessibility is now something that can be supported, even for PDFs which were never designed to do so. Standards such as PDF/UA and Section 508 compliance require that PDFs be accessible. Our accessibility operation performs a sophisticated semantic analysis of the document content and adds appropriate tagging information to produce an accessible Tagged PDF output. This includes features like headers, footers, tables, lists and sections.</p>
<P>Our ABCpdfView sample application now demonstrates this
and a whole host of other ABCpdf features. It allows you to open, view and print
PDF documents. It lets you edit text and text styles within the PDF. It allows
you to insert, delete and re-order pages. It allows you to watermark documents.
PDFView comes with full source code.</P>
<P>ABCpdf offers great control over images
in PDFs. You can resize them using a variety of sophisticated and high quality
resampling algorithms. You can assign new color spaces or convert them from one
color space to another. You can compress them in CCITT, JPEG, Flate or JPEG 2000
format. You can resample them from one bit depth to another. Determine size, resolution and placements using sophisticated analysis operations.</P>
<p>ABCpdf is fully
floating point for precise positioning of text, line and other objects at a fractional
point level. Variable precision floating point support allows you to trade off precision against legacy compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABCpdf allows even more advanced control over any PDF
object in your document. If you can't see how to accomplish a task using our simple
to use methods then you can always access the raw PDF structure directly. This is true both for the structure of the document itself and also for any content streams held within that structure. You can use the Atom classes to look at the very lowest level of the data structures involved or you can the Element classes which encompass the entire of the PDF 2.0 specification in structured classes.</p><p>If
